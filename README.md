To give it a try:
- Clone this repository
- Run a server from this repo's directory. You can use something like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` run on the command line in the repo's directory or use VSCode's Live Server extension. See [How do you set up a local testing server?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) for more info.
- Register for a Daily.co account and create a Room [in the dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co/rooms), and use that room URL on this page. You can join that room directly using other browser tabs or another device.
- Visit the server in your browser!
